<h2>History</h2>
<p><h3>The States Reorganisation Act, 1956 created the Union Territory of Delhi from its predecessor, the Chief Commissioner's Province of Delhi.[1][2] The Constitution (Sixty-ninth Amendment) Act, 1991 declared the Union Territory of Delhi to be formally known as the National Capital Territory of Delhi.[3] The Act gave Delhi its own legislative assembly along Civil lines, though with limited powers.[3]
In December 2001, the Parliament of India building in New Delhi was attacked by armed militants, killing six security personnel.[67] India suspected Pakistan-based militant groups were behind the attack, which caused a major diplomatic crisis between the two countries.[68]There were further terrorist attacks in Delhi in October 2005 and September 2008, resulting in a total of 103 deaths
